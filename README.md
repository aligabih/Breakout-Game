	<h1>Atari Breakout Game Readme</h1>
	<p>I started by creating a basic game board using a Windows Form. I added a paddle, a ball, and a set of bricks arranged in a pattern.</p>
	<p>Next, I created the logic for my game. I allowed the player to control the paddle using the keyboard. The ball was designed to bounce off the paddle and the walls of the game board. When the ball collided with a brick, the brick would disappear, and the player would earn points.</p>
	
	<p>Overall, this was a fun and rewarding project that allowed me to learn the basics of C# programming. I'm excited to continue building on this foundation and creating even more complex games in the future!</p>
	<p>If you want to try the game out for yourself, simply download the code and run it in Visual Studio.</p>
